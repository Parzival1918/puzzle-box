# Question cards

Here are the Materials Science and Engineering related questions we used for our box. You can also download a PDF file with the question cards formatted nicely [here](../../question-cards/cards.pdf). If you want to format the question cards the same way you can use the LaTeX file we used as a template, the file can be found [here](https://github.com/Parzival1918/puzzle-box/blob/main/question-cards/cards.tex).

The puzzle box has been developed by 3 students of the University of Sheffield doing the MAT4445 module.

The objective of this project was to create a Materials Science and Engineering outreach experience targeted to young students. By making it fun and engaging we hope to inspire them to pursue careers in the wonderful world of materials.

The idea of the box is to have each side locked with a different lock. Each side has a question card assigned, and the answer of the card is the combination to open the lock. To make the questions engageing, they are all based on interesting facts about materials. You can check the questions [here](question_cards). 

By making the question cards separately from the box, we let anyone who wants to use this puzzle box write their own questions which are relevant to their needs.

The box is made from plywood to make it lightweight and cheap. Some hot glue was used to join all the pieces together. In order to make it more visually appealing, we decided to decorate each side face of the box with different families of materials: metals, plastics and natural materials.
